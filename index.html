      <h2>What is a Twitter Emergency?</h2>
      <p class="writeup">A “Twitter Emergency” is a feed for tweets that have been curated by Verified Emergency Accounts for being accurate, relevant, and necessary to share. The feed helps Emergency Officials guide the conversation on Twitter to minimize the spread of misinformation and confusion during emergencies.</p>

        <h2>Technically Similar</h2>
        <p class="writeup">Our goal is to keep the solution as similar to the Twitter platform as possible 2 reasons:</p>
        <p class="writeup">To prevent Twitter Users from being confronted with the cognitive load of learning a new Interface in a stressful situation.</p>
        <p class="writeup">Also to consider potentially helping the Twitter team develop the solution easier by reusing existing code and frameworks.</p>

        <h2 class="space-above">A Twitter Team</h2>
        <p class="writeup">Twitter will need a dedicated team for verifying emergency accounts and monitoring accuracy and public engagement.</p>

        <h2 class="space-above">Measurability</h2>
        <p class="writeup">By keeping track of the emergency tool usage we could measure how often Emergency Officials are interacting with it, and how often people are viewing the information.</p>
        <p class="writeup">We can gather statistics like engagement based on how many users sign up for emergency notifications, and how often Verified content is retweeted and shared.</p>

          <h1>The Value</h1>

        <h3 class="sub-twitter">twitter</h3>
        <h2>Intangible Value: Brand Perception</h2>
        <p class="writeup">Twitter currently represents their brand through 3 Brand Pillars: Communication, Expression, and Engagement. Using these pillars as a guide, we made sure that Twitter Emergencies touches upon each in a unique way.</p>
        <h3 class="in-text">1. Communication</h3>
        <p class="writeup">  Streamlining direct communication between Emergency Officials and Twitter Users.</p>
        <h3 class="in-text">2. Expression</h3>
        <p class="writeup">  Allow users to express themselves based upon valid facts.</p>
        <h3 class="in-text">3. Engagement</h3>
        <p class="writeup">  Promote engagement to spread awareness of emergency situations.</p>

        <h2 class="space-above">Tangible Value: Business</h2>
        <p class="writeup">Twitter currently operates <a href="https://about.twitter.com/en_us/values/twitter-for-good.html">Twitter For Good</a> initiatives for civic engagement, volunteerism, and charitable partnerships.</p>
        <p class="writeup">A project like Twitter Emergencies would create relationships and partnerships with local communities and emergency services. Twitter Emergencies fits the Twitter for Good initiatives while also improving brand perception and gaining an advantage over other competitors.</p>

        <p class="writeup">We’re also providing business value through the spike of people engaging with Twitter during emergencies, whether they are regular users or not. Establishing Twitter as a credible source of emergency information could potentially increase the amount of returning and active users.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-eaccount space-above">emergency officials</h3>
        <h2>Intangible Value: Lighten the Burden</h2>
        <p class="writeup">In these stressful situations, Emergency Officials have to be focused, alert, and careful with their work. By providing this tool, we are hoping to lighten the burden of constantly answering questions and directing Twitter Users to resources.</p>
        <h2>Tangible Value: The Tool</h2>
        <p class="writeup">This tool is created to directly work with the information Emergency Officials are sending out through long and confusing reports. It helps them break down the information clearly and easily in laymans terms, and provides them with the status of being a credible resource.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-public space-above">twitter users</h3>
        <h2>Tangible Value: Emergency Feed</h2>
        <p class="writeup">This solution is immediately ready to use for any current Twitter Users. The Twitter Emergencies Feed is easily accessible and makes it easier to find credible information which can be shared to others and promote informed discussions.</p>

        <h2 class="space-above">Intangible Value: Reducing Stress</h2>
        <p class="writeup">When people know where to turn to for answers in stressful situations, it reduces the cognitive overhead of sifting through various resources like tweets and irrelevant information.</p>
        <p class="writeup">It provides people with the knowledge required to say safe and informed during emergencies, as well bring a sense of reassurance and confidence that the information is trustworthy.</p>
